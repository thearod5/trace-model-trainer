Alarm Thread,"The alarm thread evaluates fault signals to determine whether the infusion rate should be changed, issues alarm and warning signals to be sounded and displayed by the control panel, and creates fault entries to be stored in the fault log."
Failure LED,Hardware faults that prevent execution of thread cause the failure LED to illuminate.
Error Detector,The error detector detects conditions that prevent threads from operating thus could not be detected by the alarm thread.
Fault Logger,"The fault logger records all errors that are detected and maintains a hardware real-time clock used for timestamps by both event and fault logs, and by ICE messaging."
Pump Fault Manager,"The pump fault manager determines if the measured upstream and downstream flow rates are within tolerance of the specified rate, and aggregates other pump fault indications into a combined pump fault indication."
Patient Button,The patient button allows the patient to request an extra bolus of drug on demand. It may be connected by wire or RF to the PCA pump so that it is conveniently located for the patient.
Downstream Monitor,"The downstream monitor measures drug flow out of the pump and detects downstream occlusion, and air-in-line embolism."
Drug Reservoir,The drug reservoir holds liquid drug until infused.
Upstream Monitor,The upstream monitor measures drug flow into the pump and detects upstream occlusion.
Pump,"The pump moves fluid at specified rate, primes itself, announces if priming fails, indicates when itâ€™s too hot, and halts pumping when commanded."
Scanner,"The scanner reads an optical or RFID code on the patient, clinician, and the drug container that is loaded into the reservoir."
Event Logger Thread,The event logger thread records all actions or events for later review or audit.
Drug Library Thread,"The drug library thread stores the drug library provided by the hospital pharmacy, and retrieves the drug record corresponding to the drug loaded into the reservoir."
Operation Thread,The operation thread performs primary pump operation control.
Operation Process,"The operation process holds three threads for operation, drug library, and event logging."
Control Panel,The control panel combines a touch panel with a speaker by which a clinician can enter and confirm configuration and see and hear alarms and warnings.
Power Control,"The power control switches between battery-back and mains supply, and detects anomalies like voltage out-of-range."
Battery,The battery provides reserve energy to operate the PCE pump when mains power fails.
